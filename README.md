                  * Pages - page object design pattern, here will be placed the reusable code divided by pages
                  * Tests - here will be placed all the tests
                  * venv folder - virtual environment (should be in the gitignore)

                         * gitignore file
                         * conftest.py - the code that will be used in every test
